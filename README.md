This repository is designed to help you build and customize AI prompts for various SaaS applications. It provides a structured way to create, store, and manage prompts that can be used to automate tasks, generate content, or guide AI interactions in your SaaS products.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and explore the `src/components/presets.jsx` file. This file contains a collection of preset prompts that you can use as a starting point for your own applications.

### Customizing Prompts

You can customize the existing prompts or add new ones by editing the `presets.jsx` file. This file is structured to make it easy to add new prompts by defining their roles, needs, tasks, processes, exclusions, formats, and examples. By tailoring these fields, you can create prompts that are specific to your application's requirements.

### Using Wavyr Prototyper

This application was created using the [Wavyr Prototyper](https://wavyr.com/prototyper), a powerful tool for prototyping and testing AI interactions. Wavyr Prototyper allows you to quickly iterate on prompt designs and test them in real-time, ensuring that your prompts are effective and user-friendly.

To incorporate prompts from this repository into your Wavyr prototypes, simply copy the prompt details from the `presets.jsx` file and paste them into the Wavyr Prototyper interface. This will allow you to see how your prompts perform in a live environment and make adjustments as needed.
